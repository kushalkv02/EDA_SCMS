        "This data analysis project has been extremely informative in terms of understanding the operational and financial factors that impact shipment performance in the supply chain. By using systematic data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, key relationships between delivery reliability, shipment mode, cost profile, vendor terms, and planning lead time have been uncovered. The results have shown that delivery reliability is highly dependent on operational planning, shipment mode choice, and vendor accountability, while logistics costs are highly dependent on shipment weight profiles and urgent, low-volume shipments. The extreme values of cost per kilogram have been shown to be primarily associated with inefficient consolidation or emergency shipments, which implies that planning inefficiencies, rather than transportation costs, are driving financial variability. In addition, variations by managing teams, countries, and INCO terms also indicate opportunities for targeted operational improvements. In summary, the results have shown that data-driven decision-making can have a significant positive impact on both delivery reliability and logistics cost management."
